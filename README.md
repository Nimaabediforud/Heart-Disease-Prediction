# Heart Disease Prediction Project (ML & ANN)

## Overview / Objective

This project focuses on predicting whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical and demographic features.
The project covers:
- Preprocessing data for both machine learning and artificial neural network models.
- Scaling continuous features and encoding categorical variables.
- Training and evaluating multiple traditional machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Extra Trees, and Stacking Classifier).
- Building and training an artificial neural network with hyperparameter tuning and decision threshold adjustments.
- Comparing model performance using metrics such as F1-score, accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

The project highlights **the end-to-end workflow of data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and comparison** for a healthcare prediction task.

## Data Description

The project uses a dataset containing patient information and heart disease indicators. The dataset is provided as a CSV file located in the `data/` folder. It includes both numerical and categorical features that describe patient demographics, medical history, and clinical measurements.  

### Key Features:

- **Numerical Features:**
  - Continuous variables such as `Age`, `RestingBP`, `Cholesterol`, `Oldpeak`, `MaxHR`.
  - These features are scaled using `StandardScaler` & `MinMaxScaler` during preprocessing for neural network training.

- **Categorical Features:**
  - **Binary:** e.g., `Sex`, `ExerciseAngina`, `FastingBS`.
  - **Nominal:** e.g., `ChestPainType`, `RestingECG`.
  - **Ordinal:** e.g., `ST_Slope`, encoded according to predefined category order.

- **Target Feature:**
  - `HeartDisease` (0 = No, 1 = Yes) indicating whether the patient has heart disease.

> Note: Some features require preprocessing to handle missing or invalid values. For example, `RestingBP` values of 0 are replaced, `Oldpeak` negative values are corrected, and missing `Cholesterol` values are imputed using the median.

## Key Features & Highlights

- **Comprehensive Heart Disease Prediction:**  
  Implements both traditional machine learning models and artificial neural networks to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient features.

- **Data Preprocessing Pipelines:**  
  - Scaling of continuous features using `StandardScaler` & `MinMaxScaler`.  
  - Encoding of categorical features (binary, nominal, and ordinal).  
  - Handling of missing or incorrect values in key medical features.

- **Machine Learning Models (HDP-ML):**  
  - Stacking Classifier combining Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Extra Trees, and SVC.  
  - Trained and evaluated with F1 score, classification report, and confusion matrix metrics.

- **Artificial Neural Networks (HDP-ANN):**  
  - Flexible architecture with multiple hidden layers and dropout for regularization.  
  - Customizable decision threshold to balance sensitivity and specificity.  
  - Early stopping to prevent overfitting during training.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - F1 Score (weighted)  
  - Accuracy  
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - Detailed classification reports

- **Organized Codebase:**  
  - Clear separation of preprocessing, training, and evaluation code for ML and ANN workflows.  
  - Notebooks for EDA, ML, and ANN experiments.  
  - Reusable utility functions.

## Conclusion and Results Comparison

In this project, we implemented two approaches to predict whether a patient has heart disease:

1. **Traditional Machine Learning Models (HDP-ML)**
   - Models used: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Extra Trees, SVC, and a Stacking Classifier.
   - The final stacked model achieved a **weighted F1 score of ~89%** on the validation set.
   - These models performed very well despite the relatively small size of the dataset, showing strong generalization capabilities.

2. **Artificial Neural Network (HDP-ANN)**
   - Architecture: Multi-layer feedforward network with two hidden layers (16 units and 8 units) and dropout of 0.3 to prevent overfitting.
   - Training: 30 epochs with early stopping based on validation loss.
   - Evaluation: After converting predicted probabilities to binary labels using a 0.45 decision threshold, the ANN achieved a **weighted F1 score of ~87%**.
   - Confusion matrix analysis helped fine-tune the decision threshold, reducing false negatives while keeping false positives at an acceptable level.

### Key Observations:

- Both approaches yielded strong results, with only a small difference (~2–3%) in F1 scores.
- Traditional ML models slightly outperformed the neural network in this specific case, likely due to the small dataset size and effective feature engineering.
- The neural network provides flexibility for future expansion or integration of additional features or data, while traditional ML remains robust and efficient for smaller datasets.

> Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of both traditional ML models and neural networks in predicting heart disease, highlighting preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation strategies.
